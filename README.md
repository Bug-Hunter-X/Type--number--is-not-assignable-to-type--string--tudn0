This code demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The function `combineStrings` is designed to take two strings as input and concatenate them. However, in the example, a number (123) is passed as the first argument, resulting in a type error because TypeScript's type system prevents implicit conversion between number and string types. The solution involves explicit type checking or type assertion to ensure that the inputs are of the correct type before concatenation.
